# MLQD
MLQD: A Machine Learning Quantum Dataset
Qubit Mapping is a process of quantum compilation which aims to map quantum circuits to real quantum devices, MLQD is a machine learning quantum dataset for accelerate Qubit Mapping.
Our dataset contains multiple qubit mapping result using [OLSQ2](https://github.com/WanHsuanLin/OLSQ2).
The circuits come from two ways: [QASMbench](https://github.com/pnnl/QASMBench) and our method for enhancing quantum circuit.
